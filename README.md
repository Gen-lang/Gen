    <h1>Gen Programming Language</h1>
</div>

**WARNING!! THIS LANGUAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT. ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT.**

Gen is supposed to be a general-purpose programming language.

### TODO List
 - [x] Basic arithmetic
 - [x] Variables
 - [ ] If statement (logical operators)
 - [ ] String
 - [ ] For and while statements
 - [ ] Functions

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Gen-lang/PyGen.git
cd PyGen
```
Then you can run the main file:
```
python3 main.py
```

### Syntax
*Note:* **Currently Gen only supports integers and floats**

#### Variables
Variable assignment is very simple.
```
var a = 1
var b = 9

1 + (var c = 10)
>>> 11
```
#### Logical Operators
```
1 > 0
>>> 1

1 >= 4
>>> 0
```
